      Hello everyone!<br><br>
      Rhap5ody here, Im here to announce that i will
      be taking a break from updating the website for a while.
      <br><br>
      <strong>When will I come back?</strong><br>
      Sometime before <strong>May 16th, 2025</strong>
      <br><br>
      <strong>Why go on break?</strong><br>
      i feel im not at the level i should be at right now,
      ill go on break so i can learn to become a better website design for y'all.
      <br><br>
      <strong>What does this mean for YOU?</strong><br>
      not much actually! i will be continuing to add all assets up until page 5!
      (page 6 to 10 is not guaranteed, but ill try to grt them filled out).
      <br><br>
      <strong>Suggestions & Bug Fixes</strong><br>
      All suggestions are welcome to be continued to be asked of me,
      I will do as much as I can to include everyone’s suggestions 
      and get sources for the assets people want to enjoy the most.
      And of course I will be swift to deliver with bug fixes and new content,
      fair well for now but not forever!
      <br><br>
      <strong>Hide or Don’t show again</strong>
      Click the buttons at the bottom but know that either if you read or not you can click
      “don’t show again” without any worry to forget or miss out on the announcement, I will be adding the page link to the header!
